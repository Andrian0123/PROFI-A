# PROFI-A Product Manifesto v1

## Why PROFI-A Exists

PROFI-A exists to remove uncertainty from construction and renovation workflows.  
From first measurement to final closing documents, the app is a practical operating system for foremen, estimators, and small contractor teams.

## Mission

Give every contractor a reliable digital path from `scan -> estimate -> act/document -> payment confirmation`.

## Product Promise

- Fewer manual mistakes in measurements and estimates.
- Faster agreement cycles with clients.
- Transparent pricing and work progress.
- Standardized documents for both individuals and businesses (including KS-2/KS-3 workflows).

## Core Value Loop

1. Capture or input room dimensions.
2. Convert dimensions into structured work/material scopes.
3. Build estimates and acts with export-ready artifacts.
4. Track account/subscription state and project lifecycle.

If a new feature does not improve this loop, it is not core.

## Brand Meaning

The primary visual identity is **dark olive + dark green**:

- trust and calm in financial decisions,
- engineering rigor and focus,
- long-term reliability instead of trend-driven UI.

This color identity is a product rule, not just decoration.

## Principles for Future Generations

1. **Practical first**: actions must be clear on a jobsite, not only in ideal office conditions.
2. **Data continuity**: every key user action should preserve context and reduce re-entry.
3. **Local resilience + cloud growth**: core workflow should survive poor connectivity; backend adds trust, sync, and scale.
4. **Document-grade output**: exports must remain legally and commercially usable.
5. **Global-ready architecture**: language, currency, and regional pricing are first-class concerns.

## Non-Negotiable Engineering Rules

- No hardcoded UI text in feature screens.
- No ad-hoc colors in screens; only theme tokens.
- Every P0 scenario has a deterministic failure path and user-facing fallback.
- API contracts are versioned and documented.

## Definition of Strategic Success

PROFI-A is strategically successful when a small contractor can run an end-to-end project cycle with fewer errors, less admin overhead, and predictable document output, without switching between fragmented tools.
